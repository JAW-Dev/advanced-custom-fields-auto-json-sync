# Advanced Custom Fields: Auto JSON Sync #
This is an addon plugin for Advanced Custom Fields. This addon will automate the JSON sync functionality when you are using version control to update your ACF field groups.

The plugin will create the `acf-json` directory in your active theme, and scans the `acf-json` directory for any changes to the field group JSON files. When changes are detected your ACF fields groups will be updated.
